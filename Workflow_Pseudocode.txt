1. Prepare county data to define the boundaries of the study area  

- Find the spreadsheet that contains the attributes of the counties you chose for the study area  

- Join this dataset using keys to the spatial attributes found in the USA Counties shapefile 

- Create, save and name a new shapefile that contains all of the study area counties/independent cities  

2. Prepare the marsh migration/sea level rise data  

- Download and organize all the data from the C-CAP website into neat folders  

	- Link to data: https://coastalimagery.blob.core.windows.net/ccap-landcover/CCAP_bulk_download/Sea_Level_Rise_Wetland_Impacts/index.html 

- Use a for loop to iterate through all the different datasets (both by sea level rise rate and state) and do the following geospatial analysis steps 

	- Extract relevant land cover classes (see table in thesis for the values) 

	- Overlay with study area counties shapefile  

	- Create new tiff file  

	- Systematically name the tiff file based on the state and the SLR scenario.  

	- Save the new files to a folder  

3. Prepare the urban development data  

- Download and organize all the data from the ICLUS website into neat folders  

	- Link to data: https://www.epa.gov/gcx/iclus-downloads 

	- Using the ICLUS land use data from version 2.1.1  

	- Using HADGEM2 climate model as opposed to GISS  

Use a for loop to iterate through the different datasets (by climate scenario) and do the following geospatial analysis steps  

	- Reproject ICLUS into NAD83  

	- Overlay with study area counties shapefile 

	- Extract relevant land cover classes (see table in thesis for the values) 

	- Create new tiff file  

	- Systematically name the tiff file based on the year. 

	- Save the new files to a folder 

4. Join the two datasets to find the conflict zones  

- Add parameters to allow for various sensitivities selected by the user via drop down menu 

	- Sensitivities:  

		- NOAA data – SLR  

		- ICLUS data – projection year  

- In a for loop for all 6 states in the study area:  

	- Select the appropriate suite of marsh migration output tiffs based on user inputs 

	- Select the appropriate suite of development output tiffs based on user inputs  

	- Find where the tiff files overlap  

	- Create and save the new file  

	- Systematically name the new file 
	- Set symbology

5. Convert processes into a script-based ArcGIS tool
